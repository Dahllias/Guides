You want to get the god fireman talisman, don't you? Well let's get it! I will guide you step by step.

For the low tiers you want:

- Zombie Sword
- Zombie's heart
- Healing Wand - At least medium healing (30HP/s)
- Regen VII+ potions
- Radiant Power Orb (require Wolf Slayer LVL 2 to use)

Higher Tiers (Above tier XV)

- Mastiff set (require Wolf Slayer LVL 4 to use)
- Mana Flux Orb (require Wolf Slayer LVL 6 to use)
- Regen VII+ or Healing VII+ potions
- Crit potion III or IV (Allows you to have more HP with Mastiff set)
- True Protection I enchant (very expensive, you can do it without this)
- True Resistance IV potion (for tiers XX-XXII it's mostly required)
- Wither Cloak Sword (only if you have a lot of mana)

What gear I used?

- Tier I - Tier XIV - Superior set with Zombie's heart, Regen VII + Mana Flux Orb
- Tier XV - Tier XX - Mastiff armor + Crit IV + Mana Flux Orb
- Tier XXI - Mastiff armor + Crit IV + Mana Flux Orb + True Resistance IV
- Tier XXII - Mastiff armor + Crit IV + Mana Flux Orb + True Resistance IV + True Protection I on Mastiff Chestplate
