Welcome to the ultimate guide to bazaar flipping! If you're new to bazaar flipping or want to improve your skills, this guide will provide you with the information you need to succeed.

First, let's start with the basics. The bazaar is located next to the hub, and it has several features such as "buy instantly" and "sell instantly," which are self-explanatory. There are also buy orders and sell orders. The buy order is the highest price that someone is willing to pay for an item, and the sell order is the lowest price that someone is willing to sell an item for. The instant buy price is equal to the sell offer price, and the instant sell price is equal to the buy offer price, plus a 1.25% bazaar tax.

NPCs, such as the adventure NPC, can also be important for selling items. Refreshing is another essential aspect of bazaar flipping, as it allows you to find the most competitive prices.

Now, let's move on to the different types of bazaar flips. We'll start with the NPC buy to instant sell flip. This method involves buying certain items, such as ice packed ice, acacia, iron, flint, wheat, and jungle logs, from the NPC and selling them directly to the bazaar. This method guarantees profit but is limited by the amount of items you can sell to the NPC per day.

Next, there's the instant buy to NPC sell method, which involves buying items such as enchanted sugar and clay from the bazaar for less than you can sell them to the NPC. This method has a smaller profit margin per item but allows you to sell more items up to the NPC limit of around 200 million.

The buy order to sell offer method involves creating a buy order for an item, waiting for it to fill up, and then reselling it for a higher price. This method requires refreshing, and it works best with items that have a large difference between the buyer order and sell offer prices.

The buy order to wait and then instant sell or sell order method is similar to the previous method, but it requires less upkeep. Instead of refreshing the item, you create a buy order, wait for it to fill up, and then immediately create a sell order for a higher price. This method works best with items that have a high volume of sales, such as blocks of cobblestone or sand.

To succeed in bazaar flipping, you need to find items with a high profit margin and a high volume of sales. Remember that different items require different methods and that flipping is not always a guaranteed source of income. But with practice and patience, you can become a successful bazaar flipper. Good luck!
