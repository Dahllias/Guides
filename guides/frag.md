What is frag running?

Frag running is rushing the blood room to kill one of the three bosses for profit: Livid, Scarf and Bonzo. Frag running
only works in f6/f7, but preferably f7. If you are frag running f6, go for the sleeping golems, which have a 4% chance
of dropping an ancient rose, which goes for 400k per. f7 is good when a Diamond giant spawns, which drops a Diamante
handle, which goes for 900k.

Setup:

The typical class would either be mage or archer. Depending on your class, if you are mage, a good setup would be 3/4
storm with wither goggles and hyperion/midas staff. An archer setup would be full shadow assassin or Necron armor and
juju/terminator bow with bouncy arrows.

1\. Zombie knight chestplate  
If you do manage to drop a legendary zk chestplate, they go for around 1.5m

2\. Livid, Bonzo, Scarf spawn  
There are 3 bosses that can spawn in the watcher room. You will want a Livid to spawn to make the most money. Livid
fragments atm goes for around 130k, bonzo fragment for 30k+, and scarf for less than 40k.

3\. The giants  
Now this is where the real money is at. There is the Diamond Giant, Bigfoot, L.A.S.R and jolly pink giant. Every f7 run
will spawn 1 of the 4 bosses. The best giant for money is the Diamond Giant, and second is L.A.S.R. There is a 75%
chance for them to drop their respectable item.  
Diamond Giant: Drops diamante handle = 1,000,000  
L.A.S.R: Drops L.A.S.R eye = 850,000( prices messed up)

Bad money:  
Jolly pink giant: jolly pink rock = 90k  
Bigfoot: Bigfoot's lasso = 140k The typical run time is around 2-3 minutes. With this data, if you are frag running and
finish runs at around 4 minutes per run. (Including the wait time of fragbot and selling/salvaging items) That would be
15 runs per hour. Mathematically speaking, we would get: (If we got a 100% drop rate)

Giant profit:  
4 diamante handles = 4,00,000 coins  
4 l.a.s.r eyes = 3,200,000coins  
4 jolly pink rocks = 360,000 coins  
4 bigfoot lassos = 420,000 coins

Boss profit:  
5 livids = 650,000 coins  
5 bonzos = 150,000 coins  
5 scarfs = 200,000 coins
