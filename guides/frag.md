What is frag running?

Frag running is rushing the blood room to kill one of the three bosses for profit: Livid, Scarf, Bonzo and Spirit. Frag running
only works in f6/f7, but preferably f7. If you are frag running f6, go for the sleeping golems, which have a 4% chance
of dropping an ancient rose, which goes for 400k per. f7 is good when a Diamond giant spawns, which drops a Diamante
handle, which goes for 1.3m.

Setup:

The typical class would either be mage or archer or berserker. Depending on your class, if you are mage, a good setup would be 3/4
storm with wither goggles and hyperion/midas staff. An archer setup would be full shadow assassin or Necron armor and
juju/terminator bow with bouncy arrows. A bers setup would be the same as archer but use Bone Reaver/Felthorn Reaper/Giant's Sword instead of juju/terminator bow 


1\. Livid, Bonzo, Scarf, Spirit Bear spawn  
There are 4 bosses that can spawn in the watcher room. You will want a Livid to spawn to make the most money. Livid
fragments atm goes for around 100k, bonzo fragment, scarf and spirit bear for less than 1k.

2\. The golems
Involves to enter a solo F6, rushing blood, killing golems, and making a good profit from roses. Ancient Rose = 400,000 coins

3\. The giants  
Now this is where the real money is at. There is the Diamond Giant, Bigfoot, L.A.S.R and jolly pink giant. Every f7 run
will spawn 1 of the 4 bosses. The best giant for money is the Diamond Giant, and second is L.A.S.R. There is a 75%
chance for them to drop their respectable item.  
Diamond Giant: Drops diamante handle = 1,300,000  
L.A.S.R: Drops L.A.S.R eye = 300,000

Bad money:  
Jolly pink giant: jolly pink rock = 5k  
Bigfoot: Bigfoot's lasso = 7k 
The typical run time is around 2-3 minutes. With this data, if you are frag running and
finish runs at around 4 minutes per run. (Including the wait time of fragbot and selling/salvaging items) That would be
15 runs per hour. Mathematically speaking, we would get: (If we got a 100% drop rate)

Giant profit:  
4 diamante handles = 5,200,000 coins  
4 l.a.s.r eyes = 1,200,000coins  
4 jolly pink rocks = 20,000 coins  
4 bigfoot lassos = 28,000 coins

Boss profit:  
4 livids = 400,000 coins  
4 bonzos = less than 1k coins  
4 scarfs = less than 1k coins
4 spirit = 140,000 coins
