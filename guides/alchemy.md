To get started with alchemy, you will need a Brewing Stand, Glass Bottles, and a Water Bucket. These items can be
purchased from the Alchemist NPC and Builder NPC in the hub.

The best ways to gain alchemy XP is by making potions from Enchanted Sugarcane or Enchanted Fermented Spider Eyes. Both
of these items give 15,000 XP per use. To make potions with Enchanted Sugarcane, you will also need Nether Wart to
create Awkward Potions, which can then be combined with the Enchanted Sugarcane to make a Speed 5 potion. To make
potions with Enchanted Fermented Spider Eyes, you will only need normal Water Bottles to make a Weakness 5 potion.

Enchanted Fermented Spider Eyes and Enchanted Sugarcane can be crafted or purchased from the bazaar. Enchanted Sugarcane
is typically the cheaper option, but the cost difference is usually minimal. It is possible to recoup some of the cost
by selling the potions to an NPC. Speed 5 potions sell for 167 coins each, while Weakness 5 potions sell for 500 coins
each. It is recommended to not sell Level 5 potions, but instead to use them to create Level 6 potions using one
Glowstone. The selling price for a Speed 6 potion is 5,833 coins each, and for Weakness 6 potion is 12,900 coins each.

The XP needed to reach skill level 50 is 55,172,375 XP, which is equivalent to slightly over 19 stacks of either
Enchanted Sugarcane or Enchanted Fermented Spider Eyes. There are ways to gain more XP, such as having the cookie buff
which gives +25 alchemy wisdom and increases XP per potion to 20,250, or by using a god potion which increases XP per
potion to 23,250. This will bring the total amount needed down to 12.5 stacks of either Enchanted Sugarcane or Enchanted
Fermented Spider Eyes.
