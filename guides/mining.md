Mining is quite a complex skill, yes you can think of it as “Pick axe make block break” but there are many more factors in Mining that are included in Hypixel Skyblock and it's also one of the most consistent money making methods in the game, essentially unkillable.  
  

In this guide I'll cover the following:

- Mining Locations/Islands  
- Leveling/Heart of the Mountain  
- Ores/Gemstones/Powder  
- Equipment (Early/Mid/Late/Hypermaxxed)  
- Pets  
- Minions  
  

Mining Locations include,

- The Hub (Coal Mine)  
- Gold Mine (Coal, Iron and Gold (go figure))  
- Deep Caverns (Coal, Iron, Gold, Redstone, Lapis and Diamond)  
- Dwarven Mines (Ores + Mithril)  
- Crystal Hollows (All of the above + Gemstones)  
  

The Hub and Gold Mine are just the gateway to get to the Deep Caverns. So just follow the regular quest line to get to the Deep Caverns which has a Mining V requirement.

“The Deep Caverns is the second Mining location that is unlocked after reaching Mining V. This location has multiple levels that provide various resources. Each of these levels has its own type of Mob and resource. The player can continue their descent into the Dwarven Mines from the Obsidian Sanctuary by talking to Rhys.” ~ Hypixel Wiki

Once you get to the Deep Caverns your goal is to just, get to the Dwarven Mines. So work your way down until you find Rhys and he'll ask for 10 x 3 of a choice of enchanted materials. There's a cheese for this, just mine 30 Lapis, hand Rhys 10 and leave and rejoin the Deep Caverns hand him another 10 and just repeat until you're in the Dwarven Mines.

Dwarven Mines is the true start of your mining journey, it has many locations that you can discovered, including the forge, keep an eye out for the giant minecarts filled with ores dotted around the place as these are great for gaining collection super fast as they have a fast respawn rate. Also has the gateway to the Crystal Hollows.

Crystal Hollows, is essentially a sandbox of minable ores and also includes 5 locations of it's own - Crystal Nucleus, Jungle, Mithril Deposits, Precursor Remnants, Goblin Holdout and the Magma Fields.

“The Dwarven Mines, as well as its continuation, the Crystal Hollows, are locations that are dedicated for players to mine various unique ores. These areas have a unique way of upgrading the efficiency of the player, that being Heart of the Mountain.” ~ Hypixel Wiki

Levelling and Heart of the Mountain Levelling is fairly simple, the deeper you go the more XP you gain. Whatever you break you'll gain an amount of XP - Some Ores are better than others.

One of the better ways of levelling is completing commissions which you're eventually going to be doing plenty of to level your heart of the mountain tree. There's no point going too far into levelling the Mining skill as everything you do from this point in the guide is going to give you XP.

The Heart of the Mountain tree is a skill tree that you level up through completing commissions in the Dwarven Mines and Crystal hollows and is honestly where most people give up because yes, it can be boring but it's also incredibly rewarding.

Complete Comms and get XP, it's that simple. You should be doing these every. single. day. You get a bonus for completing them 4 where you get extra powder, mining xp and commission xp. You really and truly need to get your Heart of the Mountain tree at level 7 it makes a difference on if you want to make a lot of coin.

Some tips on levelling, get to HOTM (heart of the mountain) 3 in the Dwarven Mines by doing the commissions provided by the King and Emissaries dotted around the map. I recommend, just powering through this until you get to the Crystal Hollows as you get 1300 xp for your first 4 commissions of the day compared to the 1000xp you get from the dwarven mines. They award 400 XP compared to 100 XP as standard, so once you reach Crystal Hollows there really is no reason to do Dwarven Mines commissions. Use A Pickonimbus to mine the Gemstones and kill Yogs/Mine chests to get get Topaz - I'll get into equipment later.

Equipment, you'll want to start with any pick axe you can until you get to the Dwarven Mines once you're there you'll want the following.

Early Game  
- Mithril Pickaxe from Bubu  
- Glacite Armor  
- Pickonimbus 2000 if you have access to the Auction House.  
- Silverfish Pet.  
  
Mid Game  
- Pickonimbus 2000 until you hit HOTM 6  
- Gemstone Drill LT-522 at HOTM 4 if you're too lazy to kill Yogs/Bal for Topaz and have coin.  
- Gemstone Gauntlet when you hit HOTM 6, later upgrading to Pristine 5. I'd recommend starting to add Gemstones going through each level up until Perfects (don't worry about these too much but atleast get rare gemstones). Just to add, Gemstone Gauntlet is amazing for the price.  
- Yog Armor is fine, if you want and have lots of coin to spare Jaded Sorrow is a good set to start but honestly just start saving for Divan's Armor since Sorrow is quite expensive considering you'll end up getting rid of it to get Divan's anyways.  
- Divan's Armor is the best in slot, but it needs to be maxed I recommend putting 3/5 Chambers and adding a Jaderald to each pice when you can afford it. The chambers to unlock is fortune and pristine.  
- Silverfish pet.  
- Legndary Bal pet.  
- Mithril golem if you're into that sort of thing.  
- Legndary Scatha if you're rich, legendary is kinda the only viable one.  
  
Late-ish Game  
- Gemstone Gauntlet - Seriously, you can still use this just put perfects on it and the Auspicious reforge.  
- Titanium Drill DR-X655, once you start get to the point you feel you can afford an upgrade the X655 drill is great - you can start with the X555 but I would still stick to the Gemstone Gauntlet. Try to max this drill as much as possible.  
- Divan's Armor - you should definitely have this with atleast 3/5 chambers unlocked at this point with perfects and Jaded, maybe even recombobulated. Finish maxing this out with the other chambers.  
- Blue Cheese Goblin Omelette on the drill.  
  
Late Game +  
- Divan's Drill  
- Completely maxed Divan set  
- Legndary Bal Pet + Quick Claw  
- Legndary Scatha Pet + Quick Claw  
- Perfect Gemstones all the things.  
- Atleast 7m/7m Mithril/Gemstone Powder.  
  
To conclude, there's so much I could go into detail on but I'm going to provide some resources to help you as these guides are already so good there's no reason to just repeat them. These are sort of in order of which you should be reading.
