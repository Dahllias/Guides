Hello and welcome to the ultimate in-depth and only guide to bazaar flipping that you will ever need.

I recently got my old account which only had seven mil and within a day and a half it is now sitting at a pretty 150 million and hopefully by the end of this guide you will have learned to do the same.

Now I've split this guide into different sections and time stamped each one so you can skip to whatever part you need to know. All right so we're going to start off by actually going to the bazaar. So the bazaar is located right here if you didn't know right next to the hub.

And we're just going to explain the different features of the bazaar. So we have buy instantly, suddenly those are straightforward enough, you just buy and sell at the price it states. And now we have something called a buy order and a sell order.

Now the buy order is the highest price that someone is willing to pay for an item so in this case it's 3.6 and the sell order is the lowest price that someone is willing to sell an item for in this case 3.8. Now the general principle is that the instant buy price is equal to the sell offer price and the instant sell price is equal to the buy offer price of course we also have to include the bazaar tax which is 1.25 percent by default.

Now I'm just going to quickly mention the NPCs. NPCs as anywhere like the adventure over here where you can sell an item that's going to be important later on.

Now let's quickly talk about refreshing. If I can test this guy who's selling this call at 3.5 he can cancel his current order and create a new one at the most competitive price.

Now we're going to talk about all the different types of bazaar flips that you can do. These are gradually going to start off simple and then get more advanced as we go through them.

So for the first one here I'm at the builder and we are going to do the NPC buy to instant cell flip.

Now think of this as a sort of daily quest you can do to earn a good chunk of coins. At the start of every day the idea is simple, certain items such as ice packed ice, acacia, iron, flint, wheat and jungle logs settle on the bazaar for much higher than what the NPC sells them for so you can buy up the different items from the NPC and sell them directly to the bazaar. This method is good because it guarantees profit however is limited by only 10 stacks of each item which you can sell to the NPC per day.

Now the next method is the instant buy to NPC cell. This is similar to the previous method however this time we are doing the reverse. Certain items such as enchanted sugar and clay sell in the bazaar for less than you can sell them to the NPC. So you can buy up as many of the item that are cheaper than the NPC sell value and then proceed to sell them to the NPC. I will leave a link of NPC sell prices for different items in the description. There are also a limit on the total value you can sell to the NPC and I believe this to be around 200 million. This method has a smaller profit per item sold than the previous one generally speaking, but you can sell a whole lot more of them if you sell up to the NPC limit.

Now we're going to move on to the buy order to sell offer method. For every item in the bazaar, the buy order price is always lower than the sell offer price. Therefore, for any item in the bazaar, we can create a buy order and wait for it to fill up and then resell the same item for a higher price. For most items, you will need to keep refreshing the item as people will usually overbid the buy orders and underbid the sell orders. Items with a large difference between the buyer order and sell offer prices are usually a good idea to do this method with. However, if the item is very rare or expensive, it will be less profitable as the buy orders will fill up very slowly. My recommendation is that this method is best to do with most farming items as the buy orders fill up decently fast.

Now the next method is by order to wait and then instant sell or sell order. This method is similar to the previous one but requires much less upkeep, so you don't have to waste time refreshing the item. Instead, you create a buy order, wait for it to fill up, and then immediately create a sell order for a higher price. The key to success with this method is finding items that have a large difference between the buy and sell prices, but also have a high volume of sales. This method is best suited for items that are used in large amounts such as blocks of cobblestone or sand.

That concludes this guide on bazaar flipping. Remember that the key to success is finding items that have a high profit margin and a high volume of sales. I hope you found this guide useful and happy flipping!
