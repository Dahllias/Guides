Flipping Audience on the Auction House
======================================

And bizarre is an extremely effective way of earning coins in Hypixel Skyblock but most notably it's the oldest money making method and one that will remain in the game forever as a result mastering the ability to reliably flip items is an incredibly useful skill because this will allow any player to always have consistent income to spend on whatever their heart desires that being said flipping can also be quite daunting and at times a little bit overwhelming making it a relatively unappealing money making method for a lot of players especially those who are just getting started with the game so I've compiled my most valuable tips for everything flipping to create the Hypixel Skyblock flipping guide.

What is Flipping?
-----------------

To answer these questions I'm going to cover the absolute basics before we dive deep into the main content for this guide. Flipping at its core is a very simple concept, you buy an item or multiple items for a low price in respect to said item and then you resell it for a higher price, keeping the difference between the two prices as profit. The item that you choose to flip doesn't really matter and will usually be decided based on how much money you have at the time. The beauty with flipping, unlike a lot of other money making methods though, is that it will never become outdated because as long as there is a player run market and people that are buying and selling goods, this will always allow you to take advantage of supply and demand to profit by just buying low and selling high. This also makes flipping very consistent because major updates will never kill the money making method as a whole but instead it will create new flips based off of new metas and phase out old flips from previous matters.

### Entry Level Techniques

The simplest and least expensive method I'll be covering in today's guide has most definitely got to be bizarre margin flipping. With this technique, the first step is to browse around in the bazaar until you find an item that has a pretty big difference between the buy and sell price. Once you have located your item of choice, you then make a buy order or multiple buy orders for as much of the item as you'd like to flip and then you place your order 0.1 coins above the last. Then from here all you have to do is wait for players all across Skyblock to instantly sell the item you made a buy order for and then once that order fills, you can take all the items you've just purchased and re-list them as a sell offer. All that's left now is to wait until they sell offer fills and once it does, the difference between the price you originally paid and the price you just sold out will result in the profit that you earn.

When it comes to looking for the perfect item to flip, this takes a little bit of practice but it's something that you can definitely get the hang of pretty quickly. For starters, the supply and demand of the item will greatly affect how much money you will actually earn off that item and secondly, the effect of the sell-off attacks on the selling price is also a major influence. By default, the bazaar attacks all of your cell offers by 1.25 percent but with the community sharp, you can get this number down to 1.125 if you don't spend any money on gems. It's really important to keep this information in mind because a flip that might seem profitable at first glance can easily be much worse than you originally anticipated. Supply and demand is a crucial factor in flipping, and it's important to keep an eye on the market to find the best items to flip.

### Intermediate Techniques

As you gain more experience and have more coins to invest, you can start to explore intermediate techniques for flipping. One popular method is bulk flipping, where you buy large quantities of an item at a low price and resell them at a higher price. This can be a great way to increase your profit margins, but it also requires a larger investment and a bit more market research. Another technique is to keep an eye on the auction house and look for items that are being sold at a lower price than they are worth. This can be a bit more risky, but it can also yield great profits if you find the right items.

### Advanced Techniques

For experienced flippers, there are advanced techniques that can be used to maximize profits. One popular method is to use bots to automate the buying and selling process. This can be a great way to increase your profits, but it also comes with a higher risk of being banned from the game. Another advanced technique is to use player-made tools and scripts to analyze market data and find the best items to flip. These methods can be highly profitable, but they also require a significant investment of time and effort to master.

In conclusion, flipping is an incredibly reliable and consistent way to earn coins in Hypixel Skyblock. Whether you're just getting started or an experienced player, there are techniques and methods that you can use to maximize your profits. By keeping an eye on the market, researching different items, and using tools and scripts, you can consistently make a profit and achieve your financial goals in the game.
