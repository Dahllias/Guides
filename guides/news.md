Skyblock Update: New Features and Changes
=========================================

Ladies and gentlemen, a pretty interesting update has just appeared on Alpha. Not only are there a bunch of changes to the SkyBlock menu, there's also a bunch of back-end changes, a new form of cookie clicker, and also a new area in the hub that seems pretty interesting. My name is Dorelius and welcome back to Skyblock news. Let's launch right into it.

SkyBlock Menu Changes
---------------------

Starting off with the obvious, when we open our SkyBlock menu, things look a little bit different. The bottom right is pretty much cleared out entirely. There's a new booster cookie menu, a new sax menu, and there are also some changes to the calendar and events menu, as well as the recipe book which is pretty interesting.

### Bags and Recipe Book

Starting from the left on this list, we have your bags which has pretty much everything: the sack of sacks, the fishing bag, the potion bag, the quiver, and the accessory bag, all of which are accessible from here directly. If there was anything I would change about it, I would keep the accessory bag and maybe the sack of sacks on the main menu, probably putting them in this top or bottom right corner. It would be cool if you could customize how you want your menu to look. This erases a lot of muscle memory but hey, we'll get used to it, it'll be all right.

Moving over to the recipe book, you can see that there's now trades on the bottom right. This is where you can sell stuff and also get your trades going. It's a pretty normal menu. Kind of sad that you have to click twice to get there now but hey, that's just how it's going to be.

### Calendar and Events

Moving over to Calendar and Events, as you can see, it has been squashed pretty significantly. There's now not a ton of events. You can still open the full calendar, and you can claim your event rewards here which makes sense.

### Booster Cookie Menu and Cookie Clicker

If we head down to the booster cookie menu, the best stuff here is that now you can buy booster cookies directly from this menu. Also, there's Cookie Clicker on the bottom right, which now saves between lobbies. Before, if you swapped lobbies, it would disappear, your stats wouldn't keep track of anything. However, now, as you can see, there's going to be a cookie ranking for people who have clicked this dumb button a thousand times or more. I don't know why you would do that. I don't know what they're trying to do with this, but hey, it's cool and it's funny.

Other Changes
-------------

There are also some smaller changes I want to go over starting from the top here. The active effects have been moved directly into your profile menu, so you can actually look at them more easily. There have been a few changes to fast traveling now. You can go to the entrance of the crystal Hollows automatically when first visiting it. It's pretty cool, I'm really happy about this. If you don't have any pets, wardrobe, personal bank, or any bags unlocked, it will now show as locked and show what is required to unlock it instead of just hiding from the menu. This is really good, it's going to help out new players a lot and show them what they need to do. They made the quick warp to the Jerry island in the Fast Travel menu, so now it's no longer going to be on the outside here. Instead, it's going to be on the inside as you can see. They basically wanted to do this because it would clean up the menu and make it look a lot nicer and I agree with some of these changes a lot. I think this is going to take a little bit of time to learn but once people do learn it, I think they're going to love it.

Unincorporated Territory
------------------------

Now heading over to the high level level or as it's now called the unincorporated territory, we can see that there's been a couple of changes here. Notably, this area is now zoned completely differently. It's not a bug or anything like that, by the way. It's literally just called unincorporated territory. This makes me think that they're planning to do something back here in the near future. Obviously, they have a lot of plans for guilds in 1.0. This might be an area that leads to a new island for all we know but hey, this is basically the goal here and this is now what it's called. It's just a little bit of a difference.

Overall, there are a lot of changes and new features in this update, and while it may take some time to get used to, it looks like it will be beneficial for players in the long run. Keep an eye out for more updates and new features in the future.
